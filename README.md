Cryptography is a technique of securing communication by converting plain text into ciphertext. It involves various algorithms and protocols to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

Ceaser Cipher : The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques.

Affine Cipher : The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

Vigenere Cipher : The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.

One-Time Pad(OTP) : One-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted by the receiver using a matching one-time pad and key.

Data Encryption Standard (DES): DES (Data encryption standard) is an older encryption algorithm that is used to convert 64-bit plaintext data into 48-bit encrypted ciphertext. It uses symmetric keys (which means same key for encryption and decryption). It is kind of old by today’s standard but can be used as a basic building block for learning newer encryption algorithms.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a popular encryption algorithm which uses the same key for encryption and decryption It is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with block size of 128 bits, 192 bits or 256 bits. AES algorithm is widely regarded as the replacement of DES (Data encryption standard) algorithm

RSA: RSA is an basic asymmetric cryptographic algorithm which uses two different keys for encryption. The RSA algorithm works on a block cipher concept that converts plain text into cipher text and vice versa.
